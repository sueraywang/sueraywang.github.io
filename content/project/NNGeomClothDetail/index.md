## Overview

This project develops a multi-scale cloth simulation approach that combines real-time coarse physics simulation with learned yarn-level geometric details. By training neural networks to predict fine-scale displacement fields and reconstructing them using parametric surface patches, we achieve physically plausible cloth with yarn-level detail at interactive frame rates.

<summary><strong>Project Proposal</strong></summary>

### Problem Statement

Current cloth simulation methods face a fundamental trade-off between performance and detail:

- **Coarse-resolution simulations** achieve real-time performance but lack fine geometric details like yarn-level wrinkles and fabric microstructure
- **High-resolution simulations** capturing yarn dynamics are computationally prohibitive for interactive applications  
- **Existing wrinkle synthesis techniques** add visual detail but often lack physical accuracy and fail to capture complex mechanical behavior of fabric microstructure

### Motivation

Physically accurate, real-time cloth simulation with fine detail is critical for:

- Virtual try-on systems and digital fashion design
- Video games and VR/AR environments
- Film production and visual effects
- Material science and textile engineering research

The ability to simulate yarn-level fabric behavior in real-time would enable more realistic virtual garments and improve the quality of interactive design tools.

---

### Proposed Approach

A three-level geometric learning framework combining coarse physics simulation with learned yarn-level dynamics:

- **Coarse Level:** Leverage existing real-time physics simulators (XPBD, Position-Based Dynamics) for low-resolution cloth mesh
- **Fine Level:** Train neural networks to predict yarn-level displacement fields as functions of coarse mechanical features (strain tensors, curvature, stretch)
- **Reconstruction Level:** Apply parametric surface interpolation (Coons patches) to reconstruct high-resolution cloth by composing coarse geometry with learned fine displacements

**Key Insight:** Coarse simulation produces locally smooth 2D parametric surfaces that serve as a geometric canvas for fine details, enabling efficient learned detail synthesis while preserving physics.

---

### Novelty

- **Geometric reconstruction framework:** Formulating fine detail prediction as learning displacement fields in parametric patch coordinates with Coons-based C0/C1 continuous reconstruction
- **Physics-informed representation:** Learning yarn dynamics conditioned on physically meaningful coarse features rather than purely data-driven synthesis
- **Unified multi-scale approach:** Tight integration between classical physics simulation and learned mechanics through principled geometric interface

---

### Relationship to Geometric Modeling

This work fundamentally addresses geometric modeling at multiple scales by:

- Leveraging classical surface representations (parametric patches, ruled surfaces)
- Developing geometric interpolation schemes for multi-resolution reconstruction
- Learning mappings between geometric and mechanical features at different scales

The parametric surface framework provides the mathematical structure connecting coarse and fine geometry.

### Summary of Work to Date

By the time of 2025/10/31, I've made the following progresses:

- **Survey state-of-the-art cloth simulation methods and implement baseline coarse cloth simulator using existing framework:** I've used PhysX tp create a cloth simulation of simple hanging cloth.
- **Literature review on neural cloth simulation, learning-based wrinkle synthesis, yarn-level fabric mechanics, and geometrical microstructures:** Refer to the above section for detailed results.

### Analysis of Work

According to the proposed proposal, my first milestone **Foundation & Literature Review** is 90% checked. I got 10% off because the baseline cloth simulator only handles a simple case, and with study in parametric surface reconstruction techniques (also with literature review), my original thought of using surface subdivision and Coon's patch to "fill the gap" might not be fully feasible.

### Plan for Completion

So far I'll stick with my original plan by moving onto the next phase **Core Development**. Based on the literature review results, I'm concerned that I need to work on yarn-level cloth simulation for better ground truth training data (which is an unexpected extra work). Thus I might not be able to remain on schedule for the rest of the project. But I'll leave the previous plan intact for now and try to catch up.
